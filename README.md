# Ghost-Word-Game
Ghost is a written or spoken word game in which players take turns adding letters to a growing word fragment, trying not to be the one to complete a valid word. (Wikipedia)

The game has a built in dictionary and accepts as many players as demanded by the user. The user can also provide his/her own dictionary if wanted. 

The game builds on as each round progresses. On each round the players start with an empty fragment and the fragment grows as each player chooses a letter. Each player has to choose a letter so that the fragment is a substring of any word in the dictionary but not the word itself. If a player chooses a letter which completes the word, he/she will lost the round. With each loss, a player will pick up the letters G, H, O, S, T consecuti. The goal of the game is to not pickup the word GHOST. Whoever picks up "GHOST" first loses the game!
